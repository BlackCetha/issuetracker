# Experimental
This project is/was only a playground for me to learn and try out new stuff.
It probably works, but it is *probably* insecure and you shouldn't use it if
you don't plan to read the full source code and fix any flaws you encounter.


# issuetracker
Standalone HTTP-API for issue tracking services based on Node

### Install
Set up the database by importing `database.sql` and create a user.
Put the login data into `settings.json` and start `api.js`.



### Goals
The goals of this project is to provide a multi-purpose webapp.
It is usable for customer support, bug reports, etc.



### Security
The project is a one-man run only built in my free time.
I tried to make it as secure as possible but I cannot guarantee for anything.
