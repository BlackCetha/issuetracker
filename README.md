# issuetracker
Standalone HTTP-API for issue tracking services based on Node

### Install
Set up the database by importing `database.sql` and creating a user.
Put the login data into `settings.json` and start `api.js`.



### Goals
The goals of this project is to provide a multi-purpose webapp.
It is usable for customer support, bug reports, etc.

While a GUI is not yet included, it will definetely be added later.


### Security
At this time, the project is a one-man run only built in my free time.
I tried to make it as secure as possible but I cannot guarantee for anything.
Bugs will be fixed as soon as possible, but that still might be some time.
